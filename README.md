# Archivist

**Archivist** creates smart AI-powered playlists for your Spotify. Housekeeping is almost an impossible task when you've got hundreds of playlists and little to no patience for organizing your favorite tracks. With Archivist, housekeeping is a one-click chore.

## How does it work?

Archivist lets you create "smart playlists". These playlists can describe, with natural language, the type of songs that should be included. When you save songs to your `Liked Songs` library, Archivist will automatically save them into the correct playlists based on their descriptions, which are editable via Spotify.
